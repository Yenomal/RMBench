# 🧑🏻‍💻 RMBench Usage

> This project is built upon [RoboTwin 2.0](https://github.com/robotwin-Platform/RoboTwin), and you can seamlessly transfer your policy code between the two projects.

## 1. Installation
First, prepare a conda environment.

```
conda create -n RMBench python=3.10 -y
conda activate RMBench
```

RMBench Repo: https://github.com/RoboTwin-Platform/RMBench

```
git clone https://github.com/RoboTwin-Platform/RMBench.git
```

Then, run `script/_install.sh` to install basic conda envs and CuRobo:

```
bash script/_install.sh
```

## 2. Download Assets
To download the assets, run the following command. If you encounter any rate-limit issues, please log in to your Hugging Face account by running `huggingface-cli login`:

```
bash script/_download_assets.sh
```

## 3. Download 

Please run the following command to download all data.

```
bash script/_download_data.sh
```

<details>
<summary>If you need to collect the data (we actually recommend downloading it directly)</summary>

> In RMBench, we always use `demo_clean` setting.

Running the following command will first search for a random seed for the target collection quantity, and then replay the seed to collect data.

Please strictly follow our tutorial in [RoboTwin 2.0 Doc - Collect Data](https://robotwin-platform.github.io/doc/usage/collect-data.html).

```
bash collect_data.sh ${task_name} ${task_config} ${gpu_id}
# Example: bash collect_data.sh cover_blocks demo_clean 0
```
</details>
